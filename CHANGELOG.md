### âš  BREAKING CHANGES

- Changed the way ESM/CJS is handled, defaulting to ESM mode with `type: 'module'` and using the `.js` extension by default. CommonJS imports are now done through a `.cjs` extension implicitly. While this _shouldn't_ be breaking, getting bundlers and environments conditional loading "just right" is a complex and sometimes brittle process. If you run into issues, please let us know.

### Bug Fixes

- correct hasHMR check in ESM mode ([92a69e2](https://github.com/rexxars/use-hot-module-reload/commit/92a69e2df1252cfdf8079b560f96ececda1ca282))
